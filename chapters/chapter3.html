            <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.</p>
            <p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p>
            <p>'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"' </p>

                'Fury said to a
                mouse, That he
                met in the

                house,
                "Let us
                both go to
                law: I will
                prosecute
                YOU.--Come,
                I'll take no
                denial; We
                must have a
                trial: For
                really this
                morning I've
                nothing
                to do."
                Said the
                mouse to the
                cur, "Such
                a trial,
                dear Sir,
                With
                no jury
                or judge,
                would be
                wasting
                our
                breath."
                "I'll be
                judge, I'll
                be jury,"
                Said
                cunning
                old Fury:
                "I'll
                try the
                whole
                cause,
                and
                condemn
                you
                to
                death."
            </pre>
            <p>'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you thinking of?'</p>
            <p>'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth bend, I think?'</p>
            <p>'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p>
            <p>'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p>
            <p>'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p>
            <p>'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended, you know!'</p>
            <p>The Mouse only growled in reply.</p>
            <p>'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.</p>
            <p>'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'</p>
            <p>'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!'</p>
            <p>'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the Lory.</p>
            <p>Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: 'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'</p>
            <p>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p>
            <p>'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.</p>
