                    <p class="review-paragraph">
                        Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is a story about Alice who falls down a rabbit
                        hole and lands into a fantasy world that is full of weird, wonderful people and animals. It is
                        classic children's book that is also popular with adults. Personally, at 16, I found the book
                        strange and uninteresting.
                        However if I was 8-14 I would have loved the fantastic fantasy world Carroll creates. I never
                        expected the events that happened because they were bizarre and unpredictable. I loved the
                        Cheshire cat's wit and
                        intelligence. I also love the hatter because his eccentric personality reminded me of the
                        eccentric people I know. My favourite part was when Alice met the caterpillar, this was because
                        of his ambiguous conversation with Alice.
                        However, I thought the events were sometimes random and didn't always connect. I also disliked
                        the number of characters, this is because sometimes I found it uninteresting and sometimes it
                        meant that I didn't have the development of scenes I wanted.
                        I believe that it is a clever book that I world have preferred when I was younger because now I
                        have a different taste in books. Carroll has depicted a unique world that I hadn't seen before.
                        This why I believe it is a book that I would recommend.
